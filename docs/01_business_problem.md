### Business Problem

This project analyzes inpatient hospital data to identify potential partners, focusing on rural hospitals in the Midwest with a variety of services. The business question at hand is: "Which rural hospitals in the Midwest have the best financial and local reputation so that we can reach out for potential partnerships?"

The goal is to provide actionable insights using:
- Provider reimbursement patterns
- Provider busyness in relation to local population
- Hospital quality metrics
